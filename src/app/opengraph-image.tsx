/*
this Image is rendered using vercel/satori.

Satori supports a limited subset of HTML and CSS features, due to its special use cases. In general, only these static and visible elements and properties that are implemented.
For example, the <input> HTML element, the cursor CSS property are not in consideration. And you can't use <style> tags or external resources via <link> or <script>.
Also, Satori does not guarantee that the SVG will 100% match the browser-rendered HTML output since Satori implements its own layout engine based on the SVG 1.1 spec.
