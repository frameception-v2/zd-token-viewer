Architecture

The application is structured around the following key layers:
• Providers Layer: Manages global state and configurations, including wallet connections and SDK setup.
• Components Layer: Encapsulates UI elements and interactive features, such as buttons for actions and context displays.
• Hooks and Utilities: Facilitates interactions with the Frame SDK and Wagmi, handling asynchronous operations and state management.
